<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">The</span> greater part of the contents of this little volume appeared
originally in the <i>Daily Graphic</i>, in the form of a series of six
articles written in criticism of Mr. Ernest Williams&#8217;s &#8220;Made in
Germany.&#8221; To these articles Mr. Williams replied in two letters,
and to that reply I made a final rejoinder. In the present reproduction
this sequence has been abandoned. For the convenience
of readers, and for the economy of space, I have anticipated in the
text all of Mr. Williams&#8217;s objections which appeared to me to
have any substance, and, in addition, I have modified or omitted
phrases, in themselves trivial, upon which he had fastened to build
elaborate but unsubstantial retorts. By doing this I have been able
to preserve the continuity of my argument and at the same time
to cut down a somewhat lengthy rejoinder into a brief concluding
chapter. Incidentally a few new points and some further figures
have been added to the articles. This arrangement, unfortunately,
deprives Mr. Williams&#8217;s reply of most of its original piquancy; but,
in order that my readers may have an opportunity of seeing what
the author of &#8220;Made in Germany&#8221; was able to say for himself,
his letters are reprinted <i>verbatim</i> in an Appendix. I am indebted
to the proprietors of the <i>Daily Graphic</i> for their courteous permission
to republish the articles, and to the Committee of the
Cobden Club for undertaking the republication. I have only to
add that the opinions expressed throughout are my own, and that
the Cobden Club does not necessarily endorse every one of them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="caption">Our Expanding Trade.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">In</span> a little book recently published, an attempt is made to show that
British trade is being knocked to pieces by German competition, that
already the sun has set on England&#8217;s commercial supremacy, and that
if we are not careful the few crumbs of trade still left to us will be
snapped up by Germany. This depressing publication, aptly entitled
&#8220;Made in Germany,&#8221; has received the quasi-religious benediction of
an enterprising and esoteric journalist, and the puff direct from a
sportive ex-Prime Minister. Thus sent off it is sure to be widely circulated,
and, being beyond dispute well written, to be also widely read.
Unfortunately&mdash;such is the nature of the book&mdash;it cannot be so
widely criticised. It consists largely of quoted statistics and deductions
therefrom, and few readers will have the means at hand for
verifying the many figures quoted, while fewer still will have the
patience to compare them with other figures which the author omits
to mention. As a necessary consequence, a large number of persons
will believe that Mr. Williams has proved his case, and some of them
will jump to the conclusion, which is evidently the conclusion to
which Mr. Williams himself leans, that the only way to prevent the
commercial downfall of our country is to reverse the Free Trade
policy which we deliberately adopted fifty years ago.</p>


<h3>THE ART OF EXAGGERATION.</h3>

<p>That may or may not be a wise thing to do, but at least let us be
certain before taking action, or before taking thought which is preliminary
to action, that we know our facts, and all our facts. The
second point is as important as the first. On hastily reading Mr.
Williams&#8217;s book for the first time, my impression was that he had only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>erred by overlooking facts which told on the other side. On general
grounds, considering the signs of prosperity on every side, it seemed
to me impossible that the condition of our foreign trade could be so
bad as the author of &#8220;Made in Germany&#8221; paints it. A cursory
glance at a few staple figures convinced me that my general impression
was a sound one, that our trade was not going to the
dogs, and that Mr. Williams had only succeeded in producing so
gloomy a picture by fixing his gaze on the shadows and shutting
his eyes to the sunlight. On this supposition I began a more
critical examination of his book, not with a view to refuting his
positive statements, but with a view to showing that in spite of
the ugly facts which he had, on the whole usefully, brought to
light, there were counterbalancing considerations from which we
might draw, at any rate, partial consolation. This I propose
to do, but in addition I shall be able to show that many of
Mr. Williams&#8217;s alleged ugly facts are not in reality so ugly as he
makes them look, and that what he has done, in his eagerness to
prove his case, is to so choose his figures and so phrase his sentences
as to convey in particular instances an entirely false impression.
How this is done will be shown in detail later on. For the present it
is sufficient to state that it is done, and that some of the most
alarmist statements in &#8220;Made in Germany&#8221; will not bear critical
examination. In a word, the author, in his polemical zeal, has
sinned both sins&mdash;he has suggested the false and he has omitted the
true; he has misrepresented, in particular instances, the facts to
which he refers, and he has not referred at all to facts which refute
his general argument.</p>


<h3>THE WHOLE TRUTH.</h3>

<p>It is with these that I propose first to deal, with the facts which
show that our trade is in a very healthy condition, and that though
Germany is also doing well and hitting us hard in some trades, there
is no reason to believe that her prosperity is, on the whole, injuring
us. And to guard myself, at the outset, against a temptation to
which Mr. Williams has frequently succumbed&mdash;the temptation of
picking out years peculiarly favourable to my argument&mdash;I propose
to take the last ten or the last fifteen years, for which statistics are
available, and to give wherever possible the figures for each year in
the whole period. The figures that will be here quoted are all taken
from official records, except when otherwise stated.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>OUR TOTAL TRADE FOR TEN YEARS.</h3>

<p>The first point to attack is the question of the total import and
export trade of the United Kingdom. The figures are contained in
the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p>These figures may be illustrated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<span class="caption">(<i>By permission of the Proprietors of the &#8220;Daily Graphic.&#8221;</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>These figures hardly bear out the statement that &#8220;commercial dry
rot,&#8221; to use one of Mr. Williams&#8217;s favourite phrases, has already laid
hold of us. In spite of the fall in prices, the money value of our
trade, both import and export, has fully maintained its level. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>true that the year 1886, with which the diagram starts, was a year of
depression, but the point which I wish to bring out by the diagram is
not that 1895 was a better year than 1886, but that the general course
for the whole period of ten years shows no downward tendency.
Later on I shall give a diagram, covering a period of fifteen years,
which brings out the same point even more clearly. It is important,
however, at once to point out that the mere comparison of the money
totals of our trade in different years is necessarily inconclusive, because
no account is taken of prices. To get a true comparison between any
two years, say 1895 and 1890, we ought to calculate what the value
of our trade in 1895 would have been if each separate commodity had
been sold at the prices of 1890. Were this done, it would probably be
found that 1895, instead of showing a decline, would show an
immense advance. A similar comparison has been privately worked
out in one of the Government offices for the years 1873 and 1886
with startling results, which I am permitted to quote. It must be
premised that only certain articles are entered in our returns by
quantity as well as by value, and it is therefore only between these
that such a comparison as I have indicated can be made. In 1873,
the total declared value of our exports of these articles was 172 millions
sterling; in 1886, it was 131 millions, showing an apparent fall of 41
millions. But if these exports of 1886 had been declared at the
prices of 1873 the total value would have been 215 millions. In this
sense, then, our aggregate trade in these commodities in 1886, instead
of being 41 millions worse than 1873, was 43 millions better. This
is undoubtedly an extreme illustration, for the prices of 1873 were
exceptionally high, and those of 1886 exceptionally low. Nevertheless,
the illustration is most instructive as showing how extremely
misleading it may be to compare values only, without taking account
of quantities. Unfortunately, when we are dealing with the total
trade of a country, a comparison of values is the only comparison
possible, for there is no other common denominator by means of
which varied articles&mdash;say, steam ploughs, cotton piece-goods, and
patent medicines&mdash;can be brought into our table.</p>


<h3>OUR IMPORTS OF GOLD AND SILVER.</h3>

<p>To return to our diagram&mdash;it may be asked, &#8220;How does it happen
that there is such a large and growing excess of imports over
exports? Surely that is a bad sign.&#8221; On the face of it, why should
it be? It only means that we are, apparently, getting more than we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>give, and most people do not in their private relations regard that as
a hardship. There are, however, people to be found who, seeing that
we every year buy more goods than we sell, will jump to the conclusion
that we must pay for the difference in cash. Where we are to
get the cash from they do not pause to think. Hitherto the Welsh
hills have resolutely refused to give up their gold in paying quantities,
and as for the silver which we separate from Cornish lead, it is worth
something less than &pound;50,000 a year. The notion then that we pay
for our foreign purchases with our own gold and silver may be dismissed
at once, although a hundred years ago this same delusion had
not a little influence in shaping our commercial policy. As a matter
of fact, instead of sending gold and silver out of the country to pay
for our excess of imports, we almost every year import considerably
more bullion and specie than we export. The actual figures are
given in the following table:&mdash;</p>

<h3>EXCESS OF IMPORTS OVER EXPORTS.</h3>

<p>The movements of gold and silver then, instead of helping to
explain the excess of imports over exports, only increase the need for
explanation. Happily, the explanation that can be given, though it
cannot be statistical, is fully sufficient. It is fourfold. In the first
place the Custom House returns do not include in the tables of
exports the large export which we every year make of ships built
to order for foreign buyers, so that our exports appear smaller than
they really are by at least five millions a year. Secondly, an allowance
must be made for the profit on our foreign trade. If, in return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>for every pound&#8217;s worth of British goods sent out from our ports, only
a pound&#8217;s worth of foreign goods came back, our merchants would
make a better living by selling penny toys along the Strand. What
the average profit is on our foreign trade there is no means of knowing,
but putting it as low as 10 per cent. on the double transaction, we
at once account for some &pound;30,000,000 sterling in the difference
between our exports and imports. The third item in the explanation
is the sum earned by British shipowners for carrying the greater part
of the sea-commerce of the world. This sum has been estimated at
&pound;70,000,000 a year, but that is only a guess, and it is certainly a high
one. Lastly, we have the enormous sum annually due to this country
for interest on the money we have lent abroad. The amount of this
annual payment can again only be guessed at, but it probably exceeds
&pound;100,000,000 a year. Adding then these four items together, and
making every allowance for over-estimates, we not only account for
the whole excess of imports over exports, but have a balance over,
which means that we are still exporting capital to foreign countries.
The capital we export goes out in the form of mining machinery to
South Africa, steel rails to India, coal to South America; the interest
due to us comes home in the form of American wheat, Argentine
beef, Australian wool, Indian tea, South African diamonds.</p>


<h3>THE WORLD&#8217;S TRIBUTE.</h3>

<p>Of what do the Protectionists complain? Would they have us
forego the interest we are owed? Apparently Mr. Williams would,
for he says (page 19) that we ought not to spend all our income from
foreign investments &#8220;in foreign shops.&#8221; How else, in the name of the
Prophet, are we to receive all or any part of what is due to us from
foreigners, whether it be due for interest on investments, or for goods
carried, or for ships sold? Does Mr. Williams mean that we are to
compel foreign nations to pay us a couple of hundred millions a year
in actual gold and silver, and then dig a hole in the ground and sit on
our hoard like an Indian cook who has saved money out of the
perquisites of his profession? Gold and silver are useless to us
beyond a very few millions every year; if more bullion were sent the
market would reject it. If we are to be paid at all we must be paid
in foreign commodities, and the mechanism of commerce enables us
to select just those commodities which we most want. This is the
whole story of our excess of imports over exports. Furthermore, that
excess would be even greater than it is did we not every year send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>fresh millions abroad on loan to our Colonies and foreign countries, to
produce in due course (it is to be hoped) additional hundreds of
thousands in the way of interest.</p>


<h3>OUR <i>ENTREP&Ocirc;T</i> TRADE.</h3>

<p>There is one other important point to be dealt with in considering
the movement of our trade as a whole. It is this&mdash;that part of the
enormous quantity of goods we import is not consumed by ourselves,
but is re-exported to foreign countries or to our Colonies. For many
reasons it is interesting to distinguish these re-exports from the
exports of goods produced within the United Kingdom. The
separate figures for the last fifteen years are given in the following
table:&mdash;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Our <i>Entrep&ocirc;t</i> Trade and our Home Trade.</span></h4>

<p class="h4sub">In Millions Sterling.</p>

</table></div>


<p>There is not much to grumble at in these figures. Our <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i>
trade, which was supposed to be slipping away, seems somewhat to
halt in the process, in spite of the notorious and not entirely unpleasing
fact that our Colonies are now doing a larger direct trade
with foreign countries than ever before. At the same time the
figures for the exports of our own goods are most satisfactory if we
take into account the lower range of prices at which our manufacturers
are now working. Altogether there is nothing in the
general figures of our trade to justify the wild statements that
&#8220;dry rot&#8221; has set in, and that &#8220;the industrial glory of England is
departing.&#8221;</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="caption">Germany: One of Our Best Customers.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">In</span> the previous chapter it was shown that the general figures of our
import and export trade gave no indication of the ruin of our
commerce either by Germans or by anybody else. In the present
chapter it is proposed to show that though Germany is among the
keenest of our trade competitors, she is also one of our best customers.
For a sufficient indication of the truth of this proposition we have
only to turn to the annual statement of the trade of the United
Kingdom. It is true that the figures there published are not
entirely satisfactory, because much of the trade of Germany is
shipped from Dutch or Belgian ports, and credited to Holland
and Belgium respectively. But this is probably also true, and to
about the same extent, of British goods destined for Germany, and
travelling <i>vi&acirc;</i> Belgium or Holland, so that in comparing imports
and exports this factor may be neglected. The same cause of error
will probably be also present to the same extent in successive years,
so that we can ignore it when comparing one year with another.
Purely for comparative purposes then the annexed table, and the
diagram illustrating it, are sufficiently accurate, although the actual
figures for any one year by itself have, for the reasons given, little
positive value.</p>

</div>


<h3>A VERY SATISFACTORY TRADE.</h3>

<p>These figures furnish a striking answer to the alarmists who can see
in Germany nothing but a vigorous and not too scrupulous rival. In
every year during the last ten years she has apparently bought more
from us than she has sold to us. It is quite true that all the things
she has bought from us were not produced or manufactured by us.
A portion of her purchases consists of foreign or colonial goods sent
to London, or Liverpool, or Hull, and there purchased for re-sale in
Germany. But in the same way some of the goods we buy from
Germany certainly had their origin in other countries, and have only
passed through Germany on their way to us; so that the fairest way
of making a comparison is to take the whole trade in each case.
Moreover, this <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> trade of ours is not in itself a thing to be
sneezed at; it contributes a goodly fraction of the wealth of the city
of London. In order, however, to complete the picture of our trade
with Germany, the following table is appended, distinguishing in each
of the ten years under review the home produce exported from the
foreign and colonial goods re-exported. This table shows that in purely
British goods we are doing a very satisfactory trade with Germany.
Taking averages, we see that during the ten years our export of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>own manufactures and produce to German ports was at the rate of
&pound;17,800,000 a year, against a total import from German ports of
&pound;25,900,000, this figure including both German goods and other
countries&#8217; goods passing through Germany. If we recollect that
on the whole our imports from the outside world must be very much
larger than our exports, for the reasons detailed in the preceding
chapter, it will be seen that these two figures, even by themselves, are
not unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>These figures are taken from the British Custom House returns,
and are subject to the objection to which allusion has already been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>made, that the Custom House authorities have no means of ascertaining
the real origin of goods entering this country, nor the real destination
of goods leaving it. Thus, for example, everyone knows that there is
a considerable trade between Great Britain and Switzerland, yet
Switzerland has no place at all in the Custom House returns, because,
having no seaboard, all her goods must pass through foreign territory,
and each package is credited by our Customs House to the port&mdash;French,
or Belgian, or Dutch&mdash;through which the package passes to
England. In order, therefore, to provide some check on the above
figures, I have averaged in the same way the figures collected by
the different foreign countries in their Customs Houses. These
foreign and colonial figures have no more title to be considered absolutely
accurate than ours, nor do they cover quite the same ground.
Their value lies in the rough confirmation they give of the very
rough conclusion which we are able to draw from our own figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the whole, these figures tally more closely with those derived
from British returns than might have been expected, and if we make
allowance for the fact that the Colonial figures include treasure, it
will be seen that both tables show that Germany is our best customer
after the United States and India.</p>


<h3>THE ALARMIST&#8217;S ARTS.</h3>

<p>In order to obscure this important fact, while alarming the British
public with the notion that English manufacturers are being ruined
by German competition, Mr. Williams picks out half a dozen or so
items of our imports from Germany, and then exclaims in horror at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>the amount of &#8220;the moneys which <i>in one year</i> have come out of John
Bull&#8217;s pocket for the purchase of his German-made household goods.&#8221;
He prefaces his list with the unfortunate remark that the figures are
taken from the Custom House returns, &#8220;where, at any rate, fancy and
exaggeration have no play.&#8221; That is so; the fancy and exaggeration
are supplied by Mr. Williams. In 1895, he says, Germany sent us
linen manufactures to the value of &pound;91,257. He omits, however, to
mention that according to the same authority&mdash;the Custom House
returns&mdash;the value of the linen manufactures which we sold to
Germany was &pound;273,795. Again, he mentions that we bought from
Germany cotton manufactures to the value of &pound;536,000, but he is
silent on the fact that our sales to Germany amounted to &pound;1,305,000.
He does not even hesitate to pick out such a trumpery item as
&pound;11,309 for German embroidery and needlework, but he forgets to
tell his readers that the silk manufactures which in the same year we
sold to Germany were worth &pound;92,000. In the same way, were it
worth doing, one could go through the whole of Mr. Williams&#8217;s list,
pitting one article against another. It would be labour wasted. The
simple fact is that, according to the authority upon which Mr.
Williams relies for all the figures just quoted, our total exports to
Germany exceed our total imports from Germany, and no trickery
with particular items can destroy, though it may obscure, that
broad fact.</p>


<h3>A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE POLICY.</h3>

<p>But, for the reasons already explained, in replying to Mr. Williams I
do not rely wholly on British figures. It is from the double testimony
of British and foreign figures that I deduce the fact that of all our
customers Germany is one of the best. The practical moral of this
fact is sufficiently obvious. In private business a tradesman does not
go out of his way to offend a good customer, even though that
customer is also a keen trade competitor. He bestirs himself instead
to keep ahead, if possible, of his rival without doing anything to
destroy the mutually profitable trade relationship between them.
Such palpable considerations of expediency are ignored by our latter-day
Protectionists, among whom Mr. Williams deservedly ranks as a
leading prophet. Their ambition is to induce the Colonies to
discriminate in their tariffs between goods from the Mother Country
and goods from foreign countries, admitting the former on favourable
terms and penalising the latter. It is avowedly against German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>competition that this policy is directed, and we are light-heartedly
told to risk our trade with one of our best customers on the chance of
encouraging trade with Colonies which so far have shown much more
eagerness to sell their goods to us than to buy ours. Even supposing
that this policy succeeded in destroying the whole of the German
export trade to our Colonies and Possessions, the possible gain to us
would be very small.</p>

<p>Here are the figures of the trade of our three principal Colonies
with the United Kingdom and with Germany, derived in each case
from the Colonial returns:&mdash;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Trade of the following British Possessions with the United
Kingdom and with Germany.</span></h4>

<p class="h4sub">Ten Years&#8217; Average, in Millions Sterling or Millions Rx.</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="standard" summary="Trade of Colonies with UK and Germany">

</table></div>

<p>Thus these great groups of Colonies and Dependencies together
buy rather less than &pound;3,000,000 worth of German goods against
more than &pound;60,000,000 worth of British goods. Yet in order to crush
this fractional competition of Germany in neutral markets, in order to
scrape up these crumbs that have fallen from our table, we are invited
to risk the loss of a direct trade with Germany worth nearly ten
times as much as all the crumbs heaped up together.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="caption">Picturesque Exaggerations.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">It</span> has now been shown, first that there is nothing in the general
figures of our import and export trade to warrant the alarmist view
expressed in &#8220;Made in Germany,&#8221; and secondly, that the country
whose rivalry is supposed to be ruining us is one of the best of all our
customers. What I propose to do in the present chapter is to examine
some of the detailed statements in Mr. Williams&#8217;s book and to show that
in many cases the inferences he draws are so seriously exaggerated as to
amount to a positive misrepresentation of the facts. For the purposes
of this examination we cannot do better than begin with the chapter
which Mr. Williams devotes to chemicals. &#8220;The chemical trade,&#8221; he
tells us, &#8220;is the barometer of a nation&#8217;s prosperity.... The
discomforting significance of the appearance of chemicals in this
Black List of mine will, therefore, be at once apparent.&#8221; More follows
about a &#8220;Bottomless pit for capital,&#8221; and &#8220;Germany seizing the
occasion while England has let hers slide,&#8221; and so on.</p>


<h3>THE ALKALI TRADE.</h3>

<p>Thus much for generalities with regard to the chemical trade;
now for details. Let us begin with alkalies, which Mr. Williams selects
for special comment. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Here we are confronted with the damning fact that whereas
fresh uses and (owing to the growth of manufactures abroad) fresh
markets for alkali products are continually being found, the export
of the greatest alkali trader of the world was last year of little more
than half its value in the early seventies. Nor do the latest years
show any sign of recuperation. The decline since 1891 has been
continuous.... There is no question here of an insidious
advance. The matter is simply that our trade has gone to the devil,
while the Germans are piling up fortunes.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>To the average reader this paragraph would certainly suggest that
at least half our trade in alkali had already disappeared, and that the
remainder would soon be gone to the devil or elsewhere. I have not
verified Mr. Williams&#8217;s statement with regard to the early seventies,
but it is quite sufficient to point to the course of the trade during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>last fifteen years. Both quantities and values are given in the
following table:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exports of Alkali from the United Kingdom.</span></h4>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>These figures show that our alkali trade has been on the whole
remarkably steady, except for the slight ups and downs in successive
years to which all trades are liable.</p>

<p>To show these ups and downs more graphically, I have drawn the
following diagram, covering the last ten years&#8217; exports:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Diagram of the Quantities of British Alkali Exported.</span></h4>

</div>


<p>If the reader will examine this diagram and the more complete
figures given above he will be able to see how completely misleading
are Mr. Williams&#8217;s sensational statements about the British alkali trade.
I do not for a moment deny that the German alkali trade has made
remarkable progress; I only assert that there is no evidence that
&#8220;our trade has gone to the devil.&#8221;</p>


<h3>CHEMICAL MANURES.</h3>

<p>We turn next to chemical manures. On this subject Mr. Williams
remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Every farmer will testify to the exceeding value of these stuffs.
&#8217;Tis a modern means of fertilising the soil, and there can be no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>doubt that it has a very great future. Obviously then it is in the
highest degree important that England should keep a firm hold of the
trade. What, alas! is equally obvious is that England&#8217;s grip on
it is relaxing, but that Germany is tightening hers.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It may be true&mdash;probably is true&mdash;that the industry of Germany
is expanding in this as in almost every other branch of the chemical
trades. It is also true that the value of chemical manures sent by
Germany to this country&mdash;still only a quarter of what we send to
Germany&mdash;is increasing. What is not true is the statement that
England&#8217;s grip on the trade is &#8220;obviously relaxing.&#8221; The figures
are given below. They do not look much like a relaxed grip.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exports of Chemical Manures from the United Kingdom.</span></h4>

</div>


<h3>SOME SUPPOSITIONS ABOUT SALT.</h3>

<p>Salt is the next subject to which Mr. Williams turns. What he
has to say about it is more picturesque than accurate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The story is worth study. The Salt Union was formed in
England in 1889, and the manufacture of salt thereby converted
into a big monopoly.... The directors reckoned without their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Germany. They can make salt there, too. It is not so good as
the Cheshire product, but it is salt, and it is much cheaper than that
sold by the Salt Union. When that syndicate&#8217;s price went up the
German manufacturers pushed into the world market, and that to a
purpose which is strikingly illustrated in the case of our great
Dependency. India needs much foreign salt, and the Indian ryot
needs it cheap: for the salt he uses has to bear the burden of a tax.
The natural result followed: German salt to a large extent ousted
English from the Indian market.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Most impressive! if only it were true. So far as the world market
is concerned, the figures below give no indications of the havoc
alleged to have been wrought by the machinations of the Salt Union.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exports of British Salt.</span></h4>



<div class="center">
<table class="standard" summary="Exports of British Salt">
<tr><th class="tl"></th><th>1886</th><th>1887</th><th>1888</th><th>1889</th><th>1890</th><th>1891</th><th>1892</th><th>1893</th><th>1894</th><th>1895</th></tr>
<tr><td class="tl">Quantities&mdash;thousand tons</td><td>805</td><td>819</td><td>899</td><td>667</td><td>726</td><td>671</td><td>654</td><td>636</td><td>769</td><td>741</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tl bb">Values&mdash;thousand &pound;&#8217;s</td><td class="bb">588</td><td class="bb">525</td><td class="bb">486</td><td class="bb">539</td><td class="bb">653</td><td class="bb">596</td><td class="bb">539</td><td class="bb">505</td><td class="bb">604</td><td class="bb">546</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>So far as India is concerned, Mr. Williams is doubly wrong. In
the first place, German salt has not &#8220;to a large extent ousted
English.&#8221; During the past five years&mdash;it was only in 1889 that the
wicked Salt Union came into being&mdash;Indian imports of salt have
been as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Indian Imports of Salt.</span></h4>

<p class="h4sub">Thousands of Tons.</p>



<div class="center">
<table class="standard" summary="Indian Imports of Salt">
<tr><th class="tl">Years ending March 31st.</th><th>From U.K.</th><th>From Germany.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="tco">1891</td><td>273</td><td>61</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tco">1892</td><td>222</td><td>103</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tco">1893</td><td>241</td><td>47</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tco">1894</td><td>269</td><td>48</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tco bb">1895</td><td class="bb">315</td><td class="bb">82</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This does not look as if English salt were being ousted by
German. In the second place, it is not true that German salt is much
cheaper than Cheshire, at any rate so far as the Indian market is
concerned. It will be found by reference to the Indian Blue Books
that the price of German salt imported into India in 1894-5 works out
to 17&middot;6 rupees per ton, and the price of English salt only to 17&middot;0
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>rupees per ton. In other words, German salt was of the two slightly
the dearer. So much for the salt bogey which Mr. Williams had
conjured up.</p>


<h3>CHEMICAL DYE STUFFS.</h3>

<p>We next pass to chemical dye stuffs. It is undoubtedly true that
in this branch of manufacture Germany has gone ahead at a remarkable
rate, and it is also probable that some of our manufacturers have
allowed themselves to be passed in the race by neglecting the scientific
methods which Germans employ. But that is no reason why Mr.
Williams should exaggerate his case. In order to magnify the fall
in our trade, if such there be, he picks out the year of highest export
(1890) and says, Lo! since 1890 our export of dye stuffs has dropped
from &pound;530,000 to &pound;473,000. One cannot tell whether this is a real
drop in trade, or merely the consequence of a fall in price, but this we
do know&mdash;that the value of our exports fluctuates largely from year
to year, and that 1895 was a good average year. The figures for ten
years are given below:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Values of Dye Stuffs Exported.</span></h4>

</table></div>


<h3>FANCY SOAPS AND FANCY ASSERTIONS.</h3>

<p>The last point in Mr. Williams&#8217;s chapter on the chemical trades
with which it is worth while to deal is what he says about soap:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In the old days, when brown Windsor was a luxury, Englishmen
washed with soap of English make; and those who could not afford
&#8216;scented&#8217; cleansed themselves with &#8216;yellow&#8217; or &#8216;mottled.&#8217; Thanks
(partly) to Continental chemistry, we have changed all that....
The progress of practical chemistry has evidently reached a point at
which the manufacture of agreeable toilet soaps at a low figure is
possible. But why should this manufacture be so largely in foreign
hands? They twit us with our debased fondness for the tub, and
they do but add injury to insult when they send us soap for use
therein. The Germans&mdash;a non-tubbing race&mdash;have not yet invaded
the English soap market so victoriously as is their wont, though
even here the Teuton hand may be discerned by the expert in
forged trade marks.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>If this paragraph means anything at all, it means that even in the
soap industry our manufacturers are being beaten by the foreigner.
To what extent foreign soap is imported into the United Kingdom it
is impossible to ascertain, for no separate entry under that head is
kept at the Custom House. But from the German Green Books one
may learn that in 1895 Germany sent to Great Britain soap valued at
&pound;35,700. The amount sent by France may have been as much, and
probably the United States also sent us a little. The total export of
German soap to all parts of the world in 1895 was valued at &pound;197,000.
Now for the British side of the case! As to the total production
and consumption of soap in this country, no figures are available, but
everyone knows how enormous is the consumption of soap produced
by English firms whose names are household words. In addition to
their providing for the wants of probably ninety-nine out of a hundred
of their own countrymen, our soap manufacturers do an enormous
and rapidly growing business abroad.</p>

<p>Here are the figures:&mdash;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Exports of Soap from the United Kingdom.</span></h4>

<p>The following diagram illustrates the almost continuous increase
in the value of our soap exports during the last ten years:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Looking at the above figures, it will be seen that in the last six
years alone we have added to our exports a sum greater than the
total yet attained by Germany. Is it necessary to say more? What
pessimistic madness could have led Mr. Williams to &#8220;black-list&#8221; such
a splendidly-thriving and notoriously profitable industry as this,
just because he finds a few thousand hundredweight of foreign soap
creeping into the country?</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="caption">More Misrepresentations.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">Attention</span> was called in the last chapter to some of the picturesque
exaggerations&mdash;to use the mildest possible term&mdash;in which Mr.
Williams had indulged in dealing with the chemical trades. We now
pass to the two chapters which he devotes to the iron and steel and
their &#8220;daughter trades.&#8221; And at the outset let it be clearly understood
that I do not for a moment deny that in some of these trades
the progress of Germany has been relatively more rapid than our own.
A child, if it is to grow at all, must move faster than an adult. An
infant four weeks old doubles its age in a month; an adult takes
thirty or forty years to double his. Nor can we expect that the
whole world will stand still while Great Britain goes on every year
adding to her strength. All that I do argue is that the shooting-up
of the German infant does us on the whole no harm, and that there is
nothing whatever in the figures of our trade to suggest that full-grown
England is approaching senile decay.</p>


<h3>&#8220;ICHABOD! OUR TRADE HAS GONE.&#8221;</h3>

<p>With this general prelude let us turn to what Mr. Williams has
to say about the industries connected with iron and steel. He opens
by referring to a visit of the English Iron and Steel Institute to
D&uuml;sseldorf in 1880:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;And when the time of feasting and talk and sight-seeing was over,
they returned to their native land, and there, in the fulness of time,
they perused the fatuous reports of the British Iron Trade Association,
which bade them sleep on, sleep ever. And they did as they were
bid, until the other day, when they awoke to the fact that their trade
was gone.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Another paragraph, headed &#8220;Ichabod!&#8221; begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;And now all that is changed. The world&#8217;s consumption (of
iron) is greater than ever before. Yet our contribution in the years
since 1882 has dropped at a rate well nigh unknown in the history
of any trade in any land. From the 8,493,287 tons of 1882 pig
iron has gone hustling down to the 7,364,745 tons of 1894.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Truly Mr. Williams is an ingenious person. By picking out the
two years 1882 and 1894 he has cunningly obscured the fact that the
production of pig iron, as of everything else, is subject to fluctuations,
and that 1894, following worse years than itself, will in all probability
be followed by better. Here are all the figures for the last fifteen
years for which statistics are available, with the German figures set
beside them:&mdash;</p>

<p>These figures show that Germany has without doubt been rapidly
gaining upon us, but it is the grossest exaggeration to say that our
trade &#8220;has gone.&#8221; As a matter of fact the output of pig iron in the
United Kingdom rose to 7&middot;9 million tons in 1895, and&mdash;according to
the <i>Economist</i> of November 11th&mdash;the estimated output for the
present year (1896) is 8&middot;7 million tons. If that figure is realised it
will be the largest on record. So much for Mr. Williams&#8217;s &#8220;Ichabods,&#8221;
and all his talk of departed glory!</p>


<h3>COMPARISONS SAID TO BE &#8220;ODIOUS.&#8221;</h3>

<p>Turning to another paragraph headed &#8220;Odious Comparisons,&#8221; we
find&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Under the general heading of iron, wrought and unwrought, the
returns of our German exports exhibit a fall from 374,234 tons in
1890 to 295,510 tons in 1895.... Of unenumerated iron
manufactures Germany supplied us with 219,841 cwt. in 1890 and
with 311,904 cwt. in 1895.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Had Mr. Williams taken the trouble to convert the German
figures from cwts. into tons he might have found this comparison
somewhat less &#8220;odious.&#8221; If we send Germany 295 thousand tons
against 15 thousand tons she sends us, our iron manufacturers
have not much to grumble at. But, as a matter of fact, no reliance
can be placed upon these particular figures, because, as was pointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>out in a previous chapter, much of the stuff that we get from Germany
is credited in our Blue Books to Holland and Belgium, and these
countries in the same way are debited with a large amount of British
stuff that ultimately finds its way to Germany. Exactly the same
causes of error vitiate the figures published in the German Green
Books, and it may safely be asserted that there is no means of
ascertaining with even approximate accuracy how much British iron
and steel goes to Germany and how much German steel and iron
comes to Great Britain. What can be ascertained is the total export
of German iron from Germany to all parts of the world, and the total
export of British iron from the United Kingdom to all parts of the
world. This comparison, which is one of the best means of testing
the relative progress of Great Britain and Germany, is worked out in
the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p>The above figures undoubtedly show a distinct decline in British
exports of iron and steel, but they also show that that decline is not
due to the increased invasion of our own or of neutral markets either
by Germany or by Belgium. It is due to a decline which subsequent
events have shown to be temporary in the world&#8217;s demand for iron
and steel goods. Even were this decline permanent, it would not be
the fault of our manufacturers, nor&mdash;except as a device for reducing
their personal expenditure&mdash;is there any reason why these gentlemen
should sit in sackcloth and ashes.</p>


<h3>STATISTICAL LEGERDEMAIN.</h3>

<p>We pass to the subject of shipbuilding. Mr. Williams is good
enough to admit that England is actually at the head of the shipbuilding
trade. But having made this admission, a pang of regret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>comes over him, and he tries to show that he is justified in putting
even the British shipbuilding trade on his &#8220;black list.&#8221; This is his
argument:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In 1883 the total tonnage built in the United Kingdom was
892,216; in 1893 it reached only 584,674; in 1894, &#8217;tis true, it rose
to 669,492, but this is much below the total even of 1892, which
was 801,548.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Again one can only admire Mr. Williams&#8217;s ingenuity. Reading
his paragraph, who would dream that between the years so skilfully
selected for comparison the trade had experienced an enormous drop,
and afterwards, to all intents and purposes, completely recovered
itself; that then a smaller drop had occurred, and that this in turn
was being fast made good? The best way to expose the above piece
of statistical legerdemain is to give without further comment the
whole of the figures for the past fifteen years. They will be found in
the following table. With figures such as these before him&mdash;and they
must have been before him&mdash;it is astounding that Mr. Williams
should have ventured to put shipbuilding on his black list.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>SHIPS BUILT FOR FOREIGNERS.</h3>

<p>But his perverse ingenuity does not end with the paragraph
quoted. A few lines lower down he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;All these figures include vessels built for foreigners as well as
those for home and the Colonies. The year in which we built most
vessels for other nations was 1889, when we supplied them with
183,224 tons. The four following years showed a progressive
decrease, getting down as low as 89,386 tons in 1893; and though
1894 showed an increase to 94,876 tons, their upward movement
was slight compared with the successive decreases of the previous
years.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The man who wrote these sentences obviously intended to convey
to his readers the impression that our trade in the building of ships
for foreign purchasers was a declining trade. That impression is
false, and it is a little hard to understand how Mr. Williams could fail
to see its falsity. The following figures show&mdash;what to most persons
would be sufficiently obvious on reflection&mdash;that the tonnage of ships
launched at our great yards varies largely from year to year. To
pick out the year 1889, as Mr. Williams does, and declare that since
that year there has been a decline in our sales to foreigners, is as
grossly unfair as it would be, on the other hand, to pick out the year
1885, and say that since then there had been a fourfold increase.</p>

<h3>WAR-SHIPS FOR FOREIGNERS.</h3>

<p>The above figures include war-ships as well as merchant-ships
built by us for foreigners, and, noting this fact, Mr. Williams is
distressed to find what he calls a drop in our output of foreign
war-ships. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Still more remarkable is the drop in our supply of foreign
war-ships from 12,877 tons in 1874 to 2,483 in 1894.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>What is even more remarkable still is the fact that Mr. Williams
should have dared to put such a statement before the public, knowing, as
he must have known, how completely it misrepresents the truth. I
wonder what he would have said of me if I had spoken of the remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><i>growth</i> in our output of foreign war-ships as evidenced by an <i>increase</i>
from 14 tons in 1876 to 4,152 tons in 1895! Yet this statement
would have been every bit as justifiable as his own. The whole truth
of the matter of course is, that such an industry as the construction
of foreign war-ships must vary enormously from year to year, and a
comparison between any two single years can prove nothing, except
the folly or the <i>mala fides</i> of the person who makes it. In order that
the reader may see for himself the source from which Mr. Williams
drew his &#8220;remarkable&#8221; statement, I append all the figures since
1870:&mdash;</p>

<h3>MACHINERY AND STEAM ENGINES.</h3>

<p>It is becoming monotonous to follow Mr. Williams in detail
through his ingenious misrepresentations. I will therefore hastily pass
over the many pages which he devotes to &#8220;black-listing&#8221; sundry
iron and steel manufactures. His black list, which includes &#8220;steam
engines,&#8221; &#8220;other machinery,&#8221; and &#8220;tools and implements&#8221; of industry,
is arrived at by giving only the figures for 1890 onwards and ignoring
the preceding years. The unfairness of this procedure need not be
again pointed out. The figures for a decade, or for a longer period,
show that trade moves up and down, and that a depression in one
year or group of years is succeeded by an elevation a few years later.
Throughout his book, in instances too numerous to be especially
mentioned, Mr. Williams has persistently ignored this obvious fact.
Again and again he has picked out years favourable to his argument,
while even a cursory glance at a series of years must have shown him
that the truth was the exact opposite to his representation of the facts.
Here are the figures for the last fourteen years, showing the relative
progress of Great Britain and Germany in the export of all kinds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>machinery, including the domestic sewing machine and the locomotive

<h3>TEXTILES.</h3>

<p>To our textile industries Mr. Williams has devoted a chapter which
is one of the gloomiest in his book. Let it be at once admitted that
we are no longer the monopolists of the textile industries of the world
to the extent to which we once were. Nor could any sane man expect
that we should for ever retain our former exceptional position. Other
nations move as well as we. They buy the machines which we
invent and make; they employ our foremen to teach them the arts
we have acquired, and in time they learn to weave and spin for themselves
instead of coming to us for every yard of cloth or every pound
of yarn. This relative advancement of foreign nations and, too, of
our own Colonies and Dependencies was and is inevitable. It is part
of the general industrialization of the world. But what we have to
note with satisfaction is that this process has involved little or no
positive loss to us, that we are still far ahead of all other nations in
the production of textiles, and that even in those cases, notably the
woollen industry, where our export has fallen off we can point to an
increased demand by our own people for the goods we manufacture.
It is not in this spirit that Mr. Williams will look at any British
industry. Even where he has a fairly good case, he spoils it by gross
exaggeration and by the suppression of counterbalancing facts.</p>


<h3>COTTON YARN AND THE PRICE THEREOF.</h3>

<p>Dealing first with cotton, he follows his usual device of picking out
bumper years, and then exclaiming, &#8220;See what a fall since then!&#8221;
he goes on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;A consideration of moment is that this decline in values does
not signify a corresponding decline in quantities. On the contrary,
in yarn manufactures, with an actual increase in the exported
weight, there is a decrease in the cash return. Thus in bleached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>and dyed cotton yarn and twist there was a qualitative rise between
1893 and 1895 from 36,105,100 lb. to 40,425,600 lb., with a fall in
the value thereof from &pound;1,862,880 to &pound;1,832,477. Between 1865
and 1895 the average price per lb. of cotton yarn declined from
23&middot;98d. to less than 8&middot;85d. &#8217;Tis a good enough explanation of the
vanishing dividends, the low wages, the lack of enterprise and
initiative.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Mr. Williams must either be very innocent, or expect his readers to
be. He apparently has forgotten that the most important element in
the price of cotton yarn is the price of the raw cotton out of which
the yarn is spun. What the Lancashire spinner cares about is not
the absolute price of yarn or the absolute price of raw cotton, but the
margin between the two. If that be satisfactory his profit is secure.
Therefore, the mere statement that the prices of yarn have fallen so
much in so many years, by itself explains nothing. As a matter of
fact the price of cotton yarn has followed, and continues to follow,
very closely the price of raw cotton, the spinners&#8217; margin remaining
fairly constant. It is useless to go back to 1865, when the most careless
economist might surely have remembered that the American war
made cotton dear, and machines were less efficient than they now are.
But I have taken the trouble to work out for the last ten years, from
figures kindly supplied by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, the
average margin between the price of a pound of standard yarn (32&#8217;s
twist) and a pound of standard cotton (middling American). The
result shows that while the spinners&#8217; margin was slightly less in 1895
than in 1893, it stood at practically the same figure as in 1892 and
1894, and was a good deal higher than it had been in 1886. So that
here again there is no real foundation for Mr. Williams&#8217;s statement.</p>


<h3>THE DAYS OF BIG FORTUNES.</h3>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that big fortunes are no longer made in the
cotton trade, or at any rate not so rapidly as in the days when cotton
spinners waxed fat on the labour of tiny children who had to be
flogged to keep them awake. It is also true that many joint-stock
spinning companies have paid no dividends, and that many have
collapsed altogether. But those who know anything of Lancashire
know that a very large number of these companies were not started
in response to any real increase in the demand for cotton goods, nor
on account of any genuine anticipation of such an increase. They
were started, as a good many companies are started in a county south
of Lancashire, in order to put money into the promoters&#8217; pockets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Having served that purpose they were allowed quietly to collapse.
Lancashire does not miss them. That the cotton trade, as a whole, is
in a healthy condition in spite of these man&#339;uvres of the company-promoter
will be seen from the figures relating to cotton in the
following table, and from the diagram that illustrates them:&mdash;</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>LINEN, SILK, AND WOOLLENS.</h3>

<p>So much for cotton! With regard to linen, it is unnecessary to follow
in detail what Mr. Williams says, for he himself admits that the decline
which has taken place since the &#8217;sixties is largely due to a change in
fashion, jute and cotton goods taking the place of linen. In the last
decade, however, as will be seen from the above table, the linen
industry has held its own. With regard to silk, the figures show that
there is no cause for serious alarm. In woollens, on the other hand,
there is apparently better ground for Mr. Williams&#8217;s mourning. The
table on the preceding page points to a distinct downward tendency in
our export of woollen manufactures, a tendency which has been only
partly checked by the inflation of 1895. If this were the whole truth
about our woollen trade, it might be conceded that here at any rate
Mr. Williams had made out his case. But it is not the whole truth.
Almost <i>pari passu</i> with this decline in our export of woollens, which
began some twenty years back, there has been a steady increase in the
consumption of our woollen manufactures by our own people, and this
increased home demand has <i>more than made good</i> the decline in the
foreign demand.</p>


<h3>THE EXPANSION OF OUR WOOLLEN INDUSTRY.</h3>

<p>The proof of this statement will be seen in the following figures.
During the five years, 1870 to 1874, the average yearly import of raw
wool into the United Kingdom was 342,000,000 lb.; during the years
1890-94 the average was 475,000,000. That gives the measure of the
enormous increase in the amount of the raw material worked up by
our woollen manufacturers. Take next the question of the amount
of labour employed. Unfortunately, there are no official figures since
1890, but that year will serve. Here is the comparison:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Persons Employed in Woollen and Worsted Mills.</span></h4>


<div class="center">
<table class="standard" summary="Persons Employed in Woolen and Worsted Mills">
<tr><th class="tl"></th><th>Men.</th><th>Women.</th><th>Children.</th></tr>

<tr><td class="tl bb">1890</td><td class="bb">118,000</td><td class="bb">156,000</td><td class="bb">23,000</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>These figures are doubly satisfactory, for they point, first, to a
large increase in the adult labour employed; and, secondly, to a
small but gratifying decrease in child labour.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>THE NATURE OF GERMAN COMPETITION.</h3>

<p>To still further reassure politicians and others who have been
alarmed by Mr. Williams&#8217;s book, I may quote two passages from
lectures on German competition recently delivered in the West
Riding. The first is from a lecture by Professor Beaumont, delivered
in the Yorkshire College in October last. From the report in the
<i>Leeds Mercury</i> of October 10th, I take the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In the woven fabrics imported from Germany we have examples
of the standard of workmanship attained in German mills. These
textures chiefly comprise low mantle cloths and cloakings, and
limited quantities of dress stuffs composed of mixed materials,
showing that almost invariably it was the price which caused these
goods to sell in British markets. Viewed from this standpoint,
there is an impregnable argument in favour of our industrial
pursuits; for in all classes of fancy fabrics of a high quality, whether
in woollen, worsted, cotton, linen, or jute materials, the manufacturers
of the United Kingdom have scarcely felt the effects of German
competition.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>My second quotation is from a lecture delivered by Mr. Swire
Smith, of Keighley, at the Bradford Technical College, and reported
in the <i>Bradford Observer</i> of November 27th last:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Those who tell us that our English worsted industry is being
ruined by the competition of Germany, must be unaware of the fact
that the German worsteds, whose increasing exports were creating
such alarm among the Fair-traders, are mainly composed of yarns
&#8216;made in Bradford.&#8217; Indeed, Bradford afforded a concrete example
of the effect of German competition, for it would be difficult to say
which country had benefited most by it. The export of woollen,
worsted, and alpaca yarns to Germany in the average of the following
periods of years amounted in 1880-85 to 41,500,000 lb. per
year; 1890-95, to 63,800,000 lb. per year; and 1895, to 78,900,000 lb.
Bradford had been the greatest contributor to German success in
the weaving of worsteds and alpacas, and Germany had been the
greatest contributor to the success of the spinning industry of Bradford
by buying its yarns. To put a tax on German worsteds that
would shut them out of England would stop the sale of Bradford
yarns in Germany.&#8221;</p></div>


<h3>THE &#8220;PERCENTAGE TRICK.&#8221;</h3>

<p>That is enough about woollens. About jute a couple of sentences
will suffice. In order to make the facts in this trade look worse than
they are&mdash;there is nothing really bad about them&mdash;Mr. Williams first
places German figures in marks side by side with English figures in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>pounds sterling, and then plays what can only be called the &#8220;percentage
trick.&#8221; The German increase in eleven years, he says, is at
the rate of 1,100 per cent., while the British is only 19 per cent.
Remarkable! Yet Mr. Williams might have discovered from his own
figures, if he had only taken the trouble to turn marks into pounds,
that the German increase in eleven years was only &pound;107,000, while
the British increase was &pound;412,000. In other words, our increase was
almost four times as great as Germany&#8217;s, and our total is now
&pound;2,588,000, against their total of &pound;117,000. Exactly the same percentage
trick is employed by Mr. Williams in comparing German and
English trade with Japan. In this case there is also an important
error in his arithmetic; but let that pass. The trick consists in
deluding the uncritical reader into the belief that German trade with
Japan is increasing faster than our own, whereas during the period
selected by himself for comparison our increase has been almost
exactly double the German increase. It is by devices such as these
that Mr. Williams has succeeded in filling his pages with gloomy
statements and gloomier prophecies. To track him further along
his tortuous path would be profitless. &#8220;Here ends,&#8221; he writes at
the close of one of his most despairing and most deceptive chapters,
&#8220;the tale of England&#8217;s industrial shame.&#8221; If candour should be an
essential to fair controversy, there is other shame than England&#8217;s
to be ended.</p>

<span class="caption">Our Growing Prosperity.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">Having</span> now shown, both generally and in detail, how absolutely
void of foundation are many of the most gloomy statements in &#8220;Made
in Germany,&#8221; we can dismiss Mr. Williams and his fanciful forebodings,
and examine instead the direct and abundant evidence of the
growing prosperity of our country. The first point to notice is the
immense development of our shipping industry. In the last quarter
of a century the tonnage of shipping engaged in foreign trade entering
our ports has more than doubled, and this increase has been
steady and persistent, with no retrogression worth noticing in any
year. But that is not all. Twenty years ago the proportion of
British ships engaged in this foreign trade of ours was only 67 per
cent. of the total; it is now well over 72 per cent. In the same
period the number of tons of shipping per hundred of the population,
taking entries and clearances together, has risen from 130 tons to 200
tons. No other country can point to such figures. Germany, starting
from small beginnings, has improved rapidly, but her totals are
insignificant compared with our own. Only 43 per cent. of her
foreign trade is carried in her own ships, as against nearly 73 per
cent. in our case, while per hundred of the population the shipping to
and from her ports is less than a quarter of ours. If we turn to
France we find that while the total shipping to and from French
ports has increased as rapidly as with us, the proportion carried under
the French flag has appreciably fallen. In the case of the United
States there has been a still greater fall. Twenty years ago 33 per
cent. of the foreign trade of the United States was carried in United
States ships, now the proportion is only 23 per cent. The following
table shows the growth of shipping of all kinds to and from British
ports:&mdash;</p>

<p>In order to further compare our progress with the progress of other
countries the following table has been prepared to show the relative
position of the principal countries now and twenty years ago. If we
consider merely the rate of progress, the German percentage of
increase is undoubtedly better than ours. But in national life, as
in individual, it is not percentages but amounts that are important,
and the table shows that while Germany has added 6,000,000 tons to
her shipping, we have added 27,000,000 tons to ours. As long as
anything similar to that proportion is maintained we have no need to
fear German rivalry.</p>

<p>Before passing to another point it is worth while to call attention
to the enormous development of the coasting branch of our shipping
trade, as shown in the figures given above. This branch of shipping
is really of the nature of internal traffic, as distinguished from foreign
trade. That it should have increased so steadily and so rapidly is
by itself a striking proof of the commercial activity of the country.</p>


<h3>THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RAILWAYS.</h3>

<p>Proof even more convincing is apparent in the enormous development
of our railway system. It is difficult to know from which side
first to approach the tremendous figures in which this development is
portrayed. Taking, at hazard, mileage first, we find within the last
twenty-five years an increase of 6,000 miles in our railway system&mdash;namely,
from 15,000 in 1870, to 21,000 in 1895. Of this increase,
2,000 miles are due to the last decade. Looking next at the capital
expenditure, we find that in the ten years from 1885 to 1895 the
total capital of the various railway companies of the United Kingdom
rose from 816 millions sterling to 1,001 millions. Part of this immense
increase was, it is true, only nominal, being due to consolidation of
stock, etc. But when all allowance has been made on that score,
we are left with a real net increase in the ten years of 170 millions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>sterling. During the same period of ten years the receipts from
passenger traffic rose from 30 millions sterling to 37 millions,
while the receipts from goods traffic rose from 36 to 44 millions.
In the last quarter of a century the number of passengers carried by
the railways, exclusive of season-ticket holders, has risen from
337 millions to 930 millions. Were it possible to record the number
of journeys made by season-ticket holders, we should obtain an
even more striking picture of the development of passenger traffic
on our railways. Such figures as are available are given in the
next table, and illustrated by the accompanying diagrams:&mdash;</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>These diagrams and the figures they illustrate hardly look as
if the nation were on the verge of decay, ruined by German cheap
goods. If such be the signs of national collapse, no country in the
world can be called prosperous. For there is this feature about
our railway development which entirely differentiates it from the
railway expansion of newer countries&mdash;that every pound of capital
required has come out of our own pockets: we have borrowed
from no one. Instead, while planking down in ten years 170 new
millions to add to our own railways, we have been lending with large
hands to railway builders in every part of the globe.</p>


<h3>LENGTHENING TRAM LINES.</h3>

<p>From railways we pass to tramways. Here the figures are less
considerable in amount, but they are striking enough. In 1876 there
were only 158 miles of tramway open for public traffic; by 1885 that
number had risen to 811 miles, and by 1895 to 982 miles. In the
same periods the paid-up capital had increased from 2 millions
sterling to 12, and thence to 14 millions. Lastly, between 1885 and
1895 the number of passengers carried upon tramways has risen from
365 millions to 662 millions. These figures are principally interesting
because the tramcar is essentially a popular means of conveyance. If
the working-classes of this country are being reduced to starvation, as
the Protectionists say, by the invading Teuton, it is astounding that
they should be able to afford so many pennies to pay for tram fares.</p>


<h3>POST OFFICE EXPANSION.</h3>

<p>From this last comparatively limited but not unimportant test of
the general prosperity of the country, we pass to the Post Office
returns. Next to the test of railway traffic, already dealt with, no
better evidence of the prosperity and commercial activity of a country
can be found than is furnished by the growth of post office business.
A nation whose trade is being filched from it by foreigners, whose
blast furnaces are cold, and whose looms are silent, as Mr. Williams
would have us believe, does not add every year forty million letters to
the amount of its correspondence. Yet this is what we have been
doing in the United Kingdom for a good many years past. Starting
from the year ending March 31st, 1878, when a slight alteration was
made in the method of presenting the statistics, we find that in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>nineteen years that have since elapsed the number of letters delivered
annually has increased from 1,058 millions to 1,834 millions. In the
same period postcards have increased from 102 millions to
315 millions; newspapers and book packets, from 318 to 821 millions.
Moreover, the increase has been steady, with one significant exception.
In the year 1894-95, which was notoriously a year of bad trade, there
was a drop in the number of letters delivered. The drop was more
than made good in 1895-96. Turning to telegrams, we find a similar
story. Here we are compelled to start with the year 1886-87, the first
complete year after the introduction of sixpenny telegrams. In the
ten years that have since elapsed the number of telegrams delivered
has steadily increased from 50 millions to 79 millions.</p>


<h3>EVER-GROWING INCOMES.</h3>

<p>Another test of our national prosperity is furnished by the income
tax returns. When the annual value of the property and profits
assessed for income tax exhibits a steady increase, it is hard to
believe that our manufacturers, and all the classes that depend upon
them for support, are being ruined by Germans or by anybody else.
Here are the figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>The return from which the above figures are taken stops with the

date in the last Budget speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

that accompanied that speech:&mdash;</p>

<p>With such figures as these available it is difficult to understand how
people can continue to pour forth nonsense about the ruin of our
national industries. During the very decade in which the blight of
German competition was supposed to have destroyed the profits of
our manufacturers, it is clear from the above infallible test that the
incomes of our commercial, professional, and property-owning classes
have been growing with increasing rapidity.</p>


<h3>REDUCTION OF NATIONAL DEBT.</h3>

<p>Passing from taxation to the question of what has been done with
the taxes, it is sufficient to select one fact for comment&mdash;the enormous
reduction in the National Debt. Here are the figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>That is to say, that within the past ten years&mdash;the years of alleged
depression and blight&mdash;we have reduced our national indebtedness by
over 90 millions sterling. During the same period it is worth while
to point out that we have expended enormous sums in the almost
complete reconstruction of our navy. Meanwhile Germany&mdash;the
hated rival&mdash;has, since the war, added as many millions to her debt
as we in ten years have taken from ours.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>SOME STAPLE COMMODITIES.</h3>

<p>In case the pessimists and the Protectionists should be still unconvinced
by these proofs of national prosperity, let us turn to a new
series of tests, the test of consumption. The great staple commodities
which we will first take (cotton, wool, and coal) are partly required
for manufacturing purposes and subsequent export, and partly for
home use. The word &#8220;consumption&#8221; covers both uses, and we
cannot, except in the case of wool, readily ascertain to which use the
greater effect is attributable. In the case of wool it so happens, as
was previously pointed out, that our export trade in manufactured
goods has declined. But since the total consumption of raw wool
by the United Kingdom has gone on increasing, it is clear that the
decline in woollen exports has been more than made good by the
increased home demand, unless, indeed, it be imagined that woollen
manufacturers go on weaving an endless web which nobody wears.
Nor is that all, for the figures of our import trade show that in
addition we are importing considerable and increasing quantities of
foreign woollen manufactures. So that not only have the home
consumers more than recouped the British woollen manufacturer for
the decline of his export business, but so great is their purchasing
power that they can, at the same time, afford to send abroad for fresh
woollen stuffs to please their fancy. Here are the figures showing
the consumption by the inhabitants and manufacturers of the United
Kingdom of three staple articles referred to:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Consumption of Cotton, Wool, and Coal in the
United Kingdom.</span></h4>


<div class="center">
<table class="standard" summary="Consumption of Cotton, Wool, and Coal in the UK">
<tr><th class="tlo">Average of Five Years.</th><th>Cotton (Raw)<br />Million lbs.</th><th>Wool (Raw)<br />Million lbs.</th><th>Coal<br />Million Tons.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="tco">1870-74</td><td>1,178</td><td>342</td><td>108</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tco">1875-79</td><td>1,221</td><td>353</td><td>118</td></tr>

</table></div>


<p>With regard to the figures for cotton in the above table, it is only
necessary to remark that the British manufacturer, whether for sale
abroad, or for sale at home, is clearly working up more stuff than
ever before. The figures for wool have already been explained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>With regard to coal, the figures necessarily include both domestic
and industrial consumption; but whichever be the more important
element, the totals are remarkably healthy.</p>


<h3>PERSONAL AND DOMESTIC EXPENDITURE.</h3>

<p>An even better test of the increased spending power of the nation
is furnished by the figures giving the rate of consumption of such
articles of everyday use as tea, sugar, and tobacco. It will be seen
from the following table how rapidly our national consumption of
these staple articles has increased during the past decade&mdash;the decade
of alleged ruin:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tea, Sugar, and Tobacco.</span></h4>


<div class="center">

<p>It is useless to worry the reader with further figures. Evidences
of the prosperity of the country are around us on every side for those
to see that have eyes to see&mdash;a higher standard of dress in every class
of the community; better built and better furnished houses for artisan
and labourer, as well as for millionaire; new public buildings, new
libraries, new hospitals; improved paving, improved water-supply,
improved drainage; more newspapers, more theatres, more lavish
entertainments; in a word, a higher standard of comfort or of luxury
in every domain of life.</p>

<span class="caption">Let Well Alone.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">The</span> preceding chapters have been mainly statistical. Their object
has been to show, by producing the best evidence available, that
alarmists like the author of &#8220;Made in Germany&#8221; have no real ground
for their fears, that British trade is not going to the devil, but that, on
the contrary, the nation as a whole is in a condition of marvellous and
still rapidly-growing prosperity. If that be so, if there be no disease,
then obviously is there no need for the remedy which Mr. Williams
and other Protectionists are anxious to foist upon the country. But
though that conclusion will be sufficiently obvious to most minds,
there are among us hypochondriacal persons who never think that
they are quite well, and these unfortunates will still hanker after some
patent medicine to cure their imaginary ills. It is worth while, therefore,
briefly to point out how utterly unsuited to our alleged ailments,
even if they existed, is the remedy which the Protectionists propose.</p>


<h3>THE CASE FOR PROTECTION.</h3>

<p>Personally I am not a fanatical believer in Free Trade, or, for that
matter, in anything else except the law of gravitation and the rules of
arithmetic. I am quite willing to admit that there are circumstances
under which a Protectionist tariff might be advantageous to a country.
But the practical question is whether, under the present circumstances
of Great Britain, Protection is likely to bring any advantage
to her. In dealing with that question I will venture at the outset to
deny that Protection has been any real advantage to Germany. The
Protectionists are fond of arguing that the heavy import duties which
Germany levies on British goods have enabled German manufacturers
in the first place to secure their home market, and in the second
place to build up an enormous export trade at our expense. The
argument is plausible, but it suffers from one fatal defect: it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>unsupported by facts. As one reads the writings and listens to the
talk of Protectionists, one&#8217;s mind becomes unconsciously saturated
with the notion that British trade is rapidly declining and German
trade as rapidly increasing. It is upon this implied proposition that
all their arguments are based; this is the primary postulate upon
which rests their whole house of cards.</p>


<h3>THE ALLEGED EXPANSION OF GERMAN TRADE.</h3>

<p>But what are the facts? I have looked carefully through the figures
showing the progress of German trade during the last ten or fifteen
years, and I can discover no difference in character from the figures
which show the progress of British trade. Let the reader look for himself.
He will find the figures for fifteen years set out in the following
table, and a diagram to illustrate them. Let him notice that what
is called the <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> trade, consisting of goods merely passing through
the one country or the other, is in these figures excluded from the
comparison. Thus &#8220;British imports&#8221; here means the total imports
into the United Kingdom, <i>minus</i> those goods which are subsequently
re-exported; &#8220;British exports&#8221; means all articles of British production
exported from the United Kingdom. The same interpretation
applies to the German figures, all goods in transit through Germany
one way or the other being excluded. The comparison is therefore
complete. And what does it show? That, so far from Germany&#8217;s
export trade increasing by leaps and bounds, while ours is steadily
declining, German trade has followed, though at a lower level, the
same general course as British trade. Therefore, whatever else Protection
may have done for Germany, it certainly has not improved
her export trade as compared with that of the United Kingdom. An
even more striking demonstration of the utter hollowness of the Protectionist
case can be seen when we turn from exports to imports. If
Protection is to do anything for a country it must at least diminish
imports from abroad while increasing exports from home. That is
the whole object of Protection, the great ambition which every Protectionist
statesman sets before him. Has Protection done this for
Germany? Once again let the reader look for himself at the figures
and the diagram. He will see that while German exports have
remained stationary, German imports have very largely increased,
and moreover that their increase has been relatively greater than the
increase of imports into Free-Trade England.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>WOULD PROTECTION HELP US?</h3>

<p>So far, therefore, as Germany is concerned, Protection has been,
for the general ends for which it was intended, a complete failure. Is
there any reason to believe that it would be more successful in Great
Britain? Every consideration of common sense points the other way.
What Germany had to do was to build up comparatively new industries,
in face of the overwhelming competition of Great Britain.
In some instances she has been successful, and in some instances it is
possible that Protection may have helped her by giving particular
manufacturers an advantage in their home market at the expense of
the whole German nation. But in England we have no such task to
undertake. Our industries are already established; our wares are
already known in every quarter of the globe; it is our competition
that every other manufacturing country dreads. Nor is that the only
difference. In Germany and in France and in the United States it is
the home market that Protectionist manufacturers and Protectionist
statesmen are anxious to secure. All their efforts are directed
towards preventing their own citizens from purchasing British or
other foreign goods. But with us the home market is not the
primary consideration. Our business is with the whole world: our
customers are of every race and colour from the patient Chinaman to
the restless New Englander, from the supple Bengalee to the African
savage. If we can keep their custom we need have no fear of our
power to satisfy the wants of our own countrymen.</p>


<h3>ON WHAT SHALL WE LAY A TAX?</h3>

<p>It is, indeed, just because the advance of Germany in a few
limited directions has scared some people into the belief that we are
losing our foreign trade, that such books as Mr. Williams&#8217;s &#8220;Made in
Germany&#8221; are written. The whole point of their lament is that
Germany is ousting us from neutral markets. Assume that it is so&mdash;though
it is not&mdash;what then? How will Protection help us to
maintain the hold we are said to be losing? All that Protection can
do is to make more difficult the entry of foreign goods into our own
country. But what are the foreign goods that enter our country?
Four-fifths at least are food or the raw materials of manufacture. In
support of this statement I must refer the reader to the Custom
House returns to make his own classification. After going through
the figures carefully I arrive at the following rough result for
1895:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
<table class="standard" summary="Goods Entering the UK">
<tr><th class="tl"></th><th>Million &pound;&#8217;s.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="tl">Food and Drink</td><td>177</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tl">Raw Materials</td><td>163</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tl">Manufactured Goods</td><td class="bb">76</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tco bb">Total Imports</td><td class="bb">416</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Colonel Howard Vincent, I see, puts the total of manufactured goods
at 80 millions. His figure will serve as well as mine. Either shows
clearly enough the character of the great mass of our imports. On
which of the two main branches, on food or on raw materials, do the
Protectionists propose to levy a tax? It is a strange way of helping
our manufacturers in their struggle for the markets of the world to
impose additional taxation on the food of their workpeople or on the
raw materials of their industry.</p>


<h3>A NEW ROAD TO FORTUNE.</h3>

<p>There remains the comparatively small amount of manufactured
goods we import, representing articles which our manufacturers cannot
or will not produce at all, or cannot produce so cheaply as the
foreigner does. Supposing we taxed every one of these articles as it
entered our ports, where would the advantage be to British manufacturers
whose main ambition is to send their goods abroad? There
is, it is true, just one possibility of benefit to them. It is possible
that the imposition of a tax on some of these foreign manufactured
articles would enable the British manufacturer so to raise his prices in
the home market that he could afford to forego all profit on his sales
abroad and sell to his foreign customers at or below cost price.
That is the only conceivable way in which a Protective tariff could
help the British manufacturer in his rivalry with his German competitors
for the markets of the world. As for the cost of this topsy-turvy
system of trade it is to be borne of course by that patient ass
the British public. The British consumer is to be compelled to pay
more dearly for certain goods in order that some other people, Japs
or Chinamen, may be able to buy those goods below cost price.
Here, again, I will not assert that such an apparent act of folly is
not worth committing under given conditions. I can imagine a firm
or a country consenting for a time to work for less than no profit in
order to get a foothold in a new market. But we already have the
foothold, and have already worked it for what it is worth. If now we
discover that, for one reason or another, there is no more profit in it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>surely our wisest policy is to try something else. Otherwise we
might continue for ever to sell at a loss&mdash;individual or national&mdash;for
the sole pleasure of adding to the total figures of our turnover.
Even the Protectionists would hardly contend that along such lines
lay national prosperity.</p>


<h3>INTER-IMPERIAL TRADE.</h3>

<p>There is, however, another, though not entirely distinct, proposal
for dealing with the alleged mischief of German competition. It is
this&mdash;that we should try and persuade our Colonies and Possessions
to give preferential treatment to our goods in return for a similar
preference accorded by us to their goods. It would be unfair to call
this scheme Protectionist in the ordinary sense of the term, for it is
inspired as much by the desire to bring about a closer union of
different portions of the empire as by the fear of foreign competition;
but as it is with the question of foreign competition that we are here
primarily concerned, we will deal first with the Protectionist side of
the proposal. On this side the object aimed at is the destruction or diminution
of foreign competition in our Colonial markets. Undoubtedly,
were the Colonies willing to make the necessary tariff adjustments
in our favour, that object could be attained and our German rivals
could be excluded in part or in whole from Canada, from Australia,
from India, or from the Cape. So far so good. But what would
that exclusion be worth to us? In a previous article I referred to
figures showing how insignificant as compared with our own is
German trade with our Colonies. It is worth while to present these
figures in a fuller form. They will be found in the following table:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Imports into the following British Possessions.</span></h4>

</table></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>These figures are, unfortunately, two or three years behind date,
and probably a later return would show that the proportion of British
exports to our principal Colonies had fallen off and the German
proportion somewhat increased, but this change has certainly not
been sufficiently great to affect the general aspect of the table. That
table shows that more than half of the total import trade of our
Colonies is in our hands, and that our three principal rivals together
have little more than a tenth of the whole trade. Indeed, were it not
for the inevitably big trade of the United States with Canada, our
three rivals together would only have about one-fifteenth of the trade
of our Colonies. As for Germany in particular the table shows that
the amount of the trade she has so far been able to secure is absolutely
insignificant in comparison with our figures.</p>


<h3>THE COST TO THE COLONIES.</h3>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; argue the preferentialists, &#8220;German trade with our Colonies
has been growing rapidly, and may continue to grow.&#8221; Possibly it
may, if our manufacturers go to sleep; but what we have here to
consider is whether it is worth while to take any political action to
stop the possible growth of a competing trade which at present is
insignificant in amount. Remember that if such action is taken by
the Colonies to please us, we shall have to pay a price for their
complaisance&mdash;for their loss by the exclusion of German or any
other foreign goods would be twofold. In the first place the Colonial
consumer would suffer. He now buys certain German goods because
they suit him best, either in quality or in price. That privilege it is
proposed to take from him. His loss is therefore certain. Secondly,
there is a considerable danger of injury to the Colonial producer. If
the Colonies close their markets to German goods Germany may
retaliate by closing her markets to Colonial goods; and Germany is,
so far as the trade goes, a fair customer to the British Colonies.
Here are the figures:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Trade of British Possessions with Germany.</span></h4>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>WHAT CAN WE OFFER?</h3>

<p>This table shows that the Colonial producer stands to lose as
much, or more, than the Colonial consumer by cutting off trade
connections with Germany. What can we offer in return? It is
suggested by the advocates of preferential trade that we should offer
better terms to Colonial products in our markets. But already all
Colonial products, except tea and coffee, enter the United Kingdom
free, therefore we can only give better terms to the Colonies by
imposing a tax on those foreign products which compete with the
principal Colonial products. What, then, are these competing products?
With some trouble I have extracted from the Custom House returns
the following list of articles in which there seems to be tangible
competition between foreign countries and British Possessions:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>It will be seen that without exception the articles in the above list
belong either to the category of raw materials or to that of food.
Any taxation therefore imposed upon any portion of these articles for
the benefit of the Colonial producer would be a disadvantage to the
British manufacturer, either by increasing the cost of his raw material
or by diminishing the effective wages of his workpeople. Remembering
that the main object of the British manufacturer is to keep his
hold on the markets of the world, is it likely that he would ever
consent to allow himself to be handicapped by such taxation? For
all you can offer him in return is preferential treatment in Colonial
markets, whereas more than three-quarters of the trade he wishes
to retain is with foreign countries.</p>


<h3>DIVERGENT AMBITIONS.</h3>

<p>There is, however, an even more fundamental difficulty, which
neither Colonial nor British preferentialists have yet had the courage
to face. It is this:&mdash;That the Colonist and the Britisher are aiming
at different ends. The Britisher wishes to expand in ever-increasing
proportions his manufacturing business, and it is solely because he
thinks that he may possibly get a better market for his manufactures
in the Colonies than in foreign countries that he gives even momentary
approval to the idea of preferential trade. But no Colonist looks
forward to his country remaining for ever the dumping ground for
British manufactures. He wishes, and wisely wishes, to manufacture
for himself, and he has deliberately arranged his tariffs with that end.
Towards realising this ambition it will advance him nothing to shut
out the puny Teutonic infant and let in the British giant. In like
manner, if we turn from manufactures to agriculture we find the same
essential divergence of view. The Colonial producer regards England
as the best market for his meat and corn and butter. But the British
farmer wants none of it. If he is to be ruined by competition from
abroad he would as lief that the last nail were driven into his coffin
by Argentine beef as by New Zealand mutton.</p>


<h3>A DREAM OR A NIGHTMARE?</h3>

<p>These objections go to the root of the matter, and show how
futile it is to hope that the Mother Country and the Colonies will ever
agree on any scheme of preferential trade. But need we, therefore, sit
down sorrowing? Does the dream of inter-Imperial trade, if we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>come to examine it closely, really hold all the beauties that its shadowy
shape suggests? Take it either way. Take the scheme either as an
end in itself, or as a means to an end. As for the first hypothesis, if
trade is itself an end, it matters to us nothing whether we trade with
foreigners or fellow subjects; all we have to think of is the profitableness,
immediate or prospective, of the trade itself. And from this
point of view a growing trade with Germany is worth a good deal
more than a declining trade with Australasia. But most advocates
of inter-Imperial trade would not admit that their dream is an end in
itself. They adopt the second of the two hypotheses just mentioned,
and look upon the expansion of inter-Imperial trade as the most
convenient means of drawing the Colonies closer to the Mother
Country, and to one another.</p>


<h3>DOES TRADE UNITE?</h3>

<p>With that end no one will quarrel; but how will preferential trade
promote it? The preferentialists assume that mutual trade must of
necessity promote the closer union of different parts of the Empire.
Neither in individual life nor in national life can any fact be found to
support that assumption. A man does not necessarily make a
bosom friend of his baker and his butcher; he may even be at daggers
drawn with his tailor. As for nations it might almost be said that
there is the least love exchanged between those who exchange most
goods. We are splendid customers to France; we buy French goods
with open hands and ask for more, yet where is the love of France for
England? Never for a moment do the French cease to gird at us
and to try and thwart our national projects solely because we are
doing in Egypt what they have done in Tunis and are on the way
to do in Madagascar. Germany, on the other hand, is one of our best
customers; yet at the beginning of this year, when there seemed to be
a chance of war with Germany, a feeling of elation ran through the
whole of England. One more illustration: when in December, 1895,
President Cleveland&#8217;s Message aroused all decent folk on both sides
the Atlantic to protest that war between the United Kingdom and
the United States was impossible, was it of trade interests that all
men thought, or of the tie of common blood? Or, again, did Canada
pause to calculate that her best customer was her Southern neighbour,
or did she for a moment weigh that fact against the loyalty she owed
to the Mother Country?</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>A NEXUS STRONGER THAN CASH.</h3>

<p>The simple truth is that trade has no feelings. We all of us buy
and sell to the best advantage we can, and on the whole we do wisely.
It is a shrewd saying that warns men to beware of business transactions
with their own kinsfolk; nor do we need a prophet to tell us
that an attempt to fetter Colonial trade for our own benefit may lose
us more affection than it wins us custom. After all, why worry?
Our world-embracing commerce is to-day as prosperous as ever it has
been. The loyalty of our Colonists no one questions. Let well alone.
Our industrial success has not hitherto been dependent on favouring
tariffs, nor is there the slightest evidence that old age has yet laid
his hand upon our powers. As for the closer union between our
Colonists and ourselves, it will hardly be promoted by asking them
to sacrifice their commercial freedom to increase the profits of our
manufacturers, nor by taxing our food to please their farmers. It
is indeed a sign of little faith to even look for a new bond of empire
in an arrangement of tariffs. The tie that binds our Colonists
to us will not be found in any ledger account, nor is ink the fluid
in which that greater Act of Union is writ.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="caption">Conclusion.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">In</span> the foregoing pages I have been obliged more than once to accuse
Mr. Williams of misrepresenting facts in order to bolster up his argument.
That accusation I cannot withdraw. It has been deliberately
made because the facts compelled it. Doubtless in the ordinary affairs
of life Mr. Williams is not less honourable than other men, but in
his zeal to establish a case, which cannot be established, he has
blinded himself to the main facts of the matter with which he
was dealing, and has often so quoted facts and figures as to convey
an impression the reverse of the truth. Even from his own point of
view this was a pity, for it throws discredit upon the whole of his
work, whereas several of his statements are quite true. It is, for
example, true that Germany has made great progress in the chemical
and in the iron trades. It is also true that her commerce is gaining a
foothold in Eastern markets once almost exclusively our own. These,
and several other perfectly true statements, are to be found in Mr.
Williams&#8217;s pages, and might have been edifying to exalted persons who
can only discover a distorted image of the truth ten years after the main
facts have been clearly seen by those common folk who are primarily
concerned with them. To such individuals Mr. Williams, without his
picturesque exaggerations and strange twistings of the truth, might
have been really useful. As it is, he has only helped to lead them
astray. Indeed, it is much to be feared that these hasty students of
a big subject have by the perusal of Mr. Williams&#8217;s neatly-turned
sentences and epigrammatic phrases acquired an impression which
no drab-coloured statement of simple fact will ever be able to
dislodge.</p>


<h3>NOT ONLY A PROTECTIONIST PAMPHLET.</h3>

<p>One ground of complaint Mr. Williams may possibly feel that he
has against me&mdash;that I have so far treated his book as if it were only
a Protectionist pamphlet. My excuse is that the spirit of the Protectionist
breathes in almost every page he has written. Nowhere
does he show the slightest grasp of the central fact that all commerce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>must be mutual, that exports cannot exist unless there are imports
to pay for them; everywhere he speaks as if each useful commodity
sent us from abroad were a net loss to the British nation, and as if
the people who sent it were &#8220;robbing&#8221; us of our wealth. Nor is
that all. I take his chapter dealing with the reasons &#8220;why Germany
beats us,&#8221; and I find that after examining some half dozen reasons in
succession and dismissing them as unimportant, he comes to Protection
and exclaims, &#8220;Here at last, we are on firm ground.&#8221; Again,
in his next chapter he specifies &#8220;Fair Trade&#8221; as the first of the
&#8220;things that we must do to be saved.&#8221; The second is the commercial
federation of the Empire. I think, therefore, that I have
had good reason for concentrating my argument on these two points.</p>


<h3>TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND THE METRIC SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>There are, however, several minor suggestions in &#8220;Made in
Germany,&#8221; and I am glad to be able to express my full agreement
with what Mr. Williams said about technical education, about metric
weights and measures, and about the excessive conservatism of the
English people. I agree with him that it is monstrous that English lads
should nowadays have no chance of thoroughly learning any trade.
The old system of apprenticeship is almost dead, and the modern
device of technical education remains a pure farce, mainly owing to
the political influence of trade unions. In the same way I agree that
it is ridiculous that Great Britain should go on using a clumsy and
exclusive system of weights and measures, when the rest of the world
is rapidly adopting the almost ideally perfect system invented a
hundred years ago by the French. This is a striking instance of the
conservatism and self-conceit of the English race, of which Mr. Williams
so justly complains. But in this particular case, as it happens, it is
not the commercial classes who are to blame. For years Chambers of
Commerce throughout the Kingdom have petitioned for the legalisation
of the metric system, and yet last Session when a Bill to grant
this prayer was at length introduced into the House of Commons
by the Government the most audible comment from the assembled
wisdom of the nation was a silly guffaw.</p>


<h3>NO SIGNS OF DECAY.</h3>

<p>Let me, however, not be misunderstood. I agree with Mr.
Williams that these things are desirable, but not for the reason for
which he desires them. By him they are put forward as devices to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>help to stave off the impending ruin of the country. For that purpose
they are not needed, for there is not the slightest real evidence
that ruin is impending. On the contrary, we are progressing rapidly
in trade abroad and in prosperity at home. It is solely because I
believe that we are capable of making even more rapid progress, and
because I realise how great is the mass of misery still to be removed,
that I support Mr. Williams&#8217;s demand for technical education, for
metric weights and measures, for the more careful study of foreign
languages, and generally for a greater readiness to receive new ideas,
and a greater promptitude to meet new wants.</p>


<h3>THE CRY OF &#8220;WOLF!&#8221;</h3>

<p>One word more&mdash;Mr. Williams&#8217;s book has been defended, by
himself and by others, on the ground that it is a useful warning, that
the nation requires to be stirred up, and so on. Has Mr. Williams
forgotten the story of the little boy who cried &#8220;Wolf! Wolf!&#8221; when
there was no wolf? It is one thing to warn the country of a problematic
danger in the dim future; it is another to scream in the
market-place that the danger is at our doors. Mr. Williams&#8217;s book is
one long scream&mdash;a literary scream, I admit, and therefore in some
measure harmonious, but still a scream in the sense that there is no
reason behind the noise that is made. The danger is not at our
doors, our industrial glory is not departing from us, our trade is not
being ruined by Germany. On the contrary, in spite of the remarkable
progress of Germany in a few limited directions, the general figures
show that we are fully maintaining our splendid lead, if indeed we are
not actually bettering it. I cannot, therefore, admit this attempted
justification of the character of Mr. Williams&#8217;s book. To quote <i>Mr.
Punch&#8217;s</i> admirable picture, Mr. Williams, like his pupil Lord Rosebery,
has been trying to make our flesh creep. There is more harm
than humour in such a pastime. That the motives of both these
disturbers of our nerves were patriotic I do not for a moment doubt;
but their conduct is neither patriotic nor wise. It does us no manner
of good to be for ever cheapening ourselves in the eyes of the world.
A great nation should have dignity enough to be silent about her
own greatness, neither on the one hand perpetually boasting of her
pre-eminent virtue, nor on the other fretfully asking how her credit
stands with other countries. We are what we are&mdash;what our forefathers
and our own brains and arms have made us. Let us be
content to possess our souls in peace, and to get on with our work.</p>

<p class="letterhead"><i>To the Editor of the &#8220;Daily Graphic.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The first reflection arising from a perusal of your correspondent&#8217;s criticism of
&#8220;Made in Germany&#8221; is that perhaps it is as well that he and I are English and not French
journalists. Across the Channel disagreeable formalities sometimes ensue when one writer
takes to dealing in such expressions as &#8220;artfully picked out,&#8221; &#8220;trickery,&#8221; &#8220;gross exaggeration
and suppression,&#8221; &#8220;misrepresentations,&#8221; &#8220;exaggerations&mdash;to use the mildest
possible term,&#8221; &#8220;grossest exaggeration,&#8221; &#8220;skilfully conveyed a false impression,&#8221; &#8220;twisting
the truth,&#8221; and others of like offensiveness. As they are a direct impeachment of my honour
as a man, apart from my ability as an economist, I am compelled to preface my defence with
a protest. The adoption of this style is a pity, too, in that it was wholly unnecessary. My
antagonist was not in the position of the proverbially abusive lawyer; he had a case to state;
and, apart from personalities and some other faults to be mentioned later, I sincerely congratulate
him on the ability with which he has stated that case. Of course no one will
mistake my meaning. By admitting that my opponent has a case I am not confessing defeat;
I am simply testifying to the general truth of the saying that there are two sides to every
question, albeit one side is the right one.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This reply has been reprinted <i>verbatim</i> from the <i>Daily Graphic</i>. On the other hand, in preparing my
own articles for republication I have made certain modifications with a view of meeting Mr. Williams&#8217;s
objections, where I thought they were worth that trouble. Many of the objections have therefore lost their
point; but I thought it better to let Mr. Williams&#8217;s reply stand as he wrote it.</p></div>


<h3>THE &#8220;ADVOCATUS DIABOLUS.&#8221;</h3>

<p>It is possible to raise objections (and not necessarily foolish objections) to almost any
thesis, and the thesis is not hurt thereby. The Vatican wisely employs an <i>advocatus diabolus</i>,
whose paradoxical function is to establish the sanctity of a candidate for canonisation by
alleging all of what is not saintly that he can rake up in the candidate&#8217;s career. Your
correspondent has acted as <i>advocatus diabolus</i> to &#8220;Made in Germany.&#8221; He has said what
there is to be said for the other side, and my book, I respectfully submit, is uninjured.
Unfortunately in this case it is the case of the <i>advocatus diabolus</i> only with which most of his
readers are acquainted&mdash;a circumstance calculated to obscure their judgment. To them I
would say: Read my book; you can buy it for half-a-crown, or you can get it for nothing
out of the Free Library. This is not a puff of my own wares; it is a necessity of the case.
Until you have read the book you cannot form an opinion on the worth of the attack. The
small space allotted to me for criticism of my critic is obviously quite insufficient to prove a
case which was with difficulty compressed into 174 octavo pages; neither, apart from consideration
of space, would you thank me for copying out matter already published elsewhere.
You will therefore kindly bear in mind that the ensuing remarks are not a complete statement
of my position, but only some supplementary criticisms prompted by the attack.</p>


<h3>NOT A PROTECTIONIST PAMPHLET.</h3>

<p>First, I join issue with respect to the motive and nature of my book. Your correspondent
says that I lean to the conclusion that &#8220;the only way to prevent the commercial downfall of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>our country is to revise the Free Trade policy which we deliberately adopted fifty years ago,&#8221;
and, as his readers will remember, he proceeds on that assumption, and reiterates that
statement throughout his articles. It is really unpardonable. Would any of those readers,
who were not also readers of my book, imagine that the first chapter of that book contains a
disclaimer of holding a brief in favour of any particular doctrine or remedy, Fair Trade being
specially named; that not more than seven of my 174 pages are concerned with Protection;
that I strenuously and at considerable length advocate other reforms, and often point to other
matters as being the determining causes of the decline in a particular trade? Your correspondent
knew all this perfectly well, and yet, in order to damage my book with a Free Trade
public, deliberately conveyed to them the impression that &#8220;Made in Germany&#8221; was merely
a Protectionist pamphlet. He omitted all reference to technical education, the superiority of
German business methods, and the other reforms whose advocacy formed the bulk of the
book. And this is the man who sprinkles around charges of &#8220;misrepresentation,&#8221; and of
having &#8220;skilfully conveyed a false impression&#8221;! From a child I was never much impressed
by outbreaks of virtuous indignation.</p>


<h3>THE CHARGE OF DATE-COOKING.</h3>

<p>He reviles me for my dates, and in his own diagrams proves the wisdom of my choice.
The object of my book was to show that England&#8217;s industrial supremacy was departing.
Clearly the way to do this was to show the height to which that supremacy had attained, and
to contrast it with the position to-day. Now, his first diagram shows that the highest point
was reached at the commencement of the nineties. Of course, therefore, I made my comparisons
beginning with that period, except where the decline had begun earlier. What is
there wrong in this? Similarly I am derided as an &#8220;ingenious person&#8221; because, in order to
show that our production of pig-iron was on the downward grade, I gave the figures for 1882,
the highest year, and for 1894, the latest available year. If there were any truth in the
charge of date-cooking I should have given to my readers the figures for 1892, which was
the lowest year since 1882. It has suited the correspondent to misconceive the whole purport
of my book. I was not writing an industrial history of Europe for use in schools. My work
was to rouse the manufacturers of England to a sense of the danger threatening their
dominion, and I went in detail through the various trades wherein this danger was apparent,
showing how great they had been and what was their condition to-day. In different trades
the decadence had begun at different periods; to take the same starting year of comparison
in each case would, therefore, have been a stupid error. &#8220;Made in Germany&#8221; is a call to
arms, not an academic disquisition on the movements of trade.</p>


<h3>&#8220;ARTFUL AND INGENIOUS.&#8221;</h3>

<p>But what of your correspondent&#8217;s method? With a large air of virtuous impartiality he
adopts 1886 for his starting-point all through his tables. It may be my denseness, but
beyond meaningless uniformity, I can see absolutely nothing in this method to commend it.
I see, however, that it is very useful for optimistic purposes. Did it not strike the reader
that, in most industries, 1886 was a year of bad trade, and that therefore its adoption as a
starting year of comparison would result in a very inaccurate view of England&#8217;s former
industrial glory? If I felt inclined to adopt his language towards myself I might be tempted
to say that his choice of years was &#8220;artful&#8221; and &#8220;ingenious,&#8221; for to say, with blunt frankness,
&#8220;I will take the last decade and stick to it all through,&#8221; is an admirable way to score
with the unsuspecting public. The pose of impartiality is excellent. Your correspondent&#8217;s
figures are doubtless as correct as they are interesting, but (in the light of the explanation I
have given) I submit that those diagrams might as well have remained undrawn; they do not
destroy the tables in &#8220;Made in Germany,&#8221; and, so far as dates are concerned, are ineffectual
as a commentary.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>THE ABUSE OF STATISTICS.</h3>

<p>Your correspondent has a better case for his diagrams when he gives weights as a set-off
against money figures, and I cannot, of course, take exception to the use of those statistics.
But I do take exception to their abuse; and when he attempts to draw from them the
inference that the British manufacturer has nothing to complain of in the matter of falling
prices, I suggest that there is an abuse. Of course, in some industries the decrease in the
price of raw material has made it possible to manufacture for a lower price, but your correspondent
goes much farther than the facts warrant when he assumes that the difference in
price is balanced by an all-round difference in raw material. He forgets, for example, that
coal, which in most manufactures is an item of prime importance in the cost of production,
is not cheaper than it used to be in his favourite year 1886. Then the average price was
8&middot;45s. per ton, in 1894 it was 10&middot;50s. per ton. Wages, too, are an even more important item,
and these are on the upward grade. So also are rent, rates and taxes. Take his champion
instance of the cotton trade. Men used to make fortunes at it. Whoever hears of fortunes
being made to-day in cotton manufacture? What we do learn is that recently fifty-two out
of ninety-three spinning companies were paying no dividend at all. Prices are cut because
of foreign competition. The foreigners have to cut their prices too, but that does not make
the fact of foreign competition any the less disagreeable. I still think, therefore, that I
followed the right method in laying more stress on money than on weights and measures, and
anyway no harm could be done by it, because I used money figures for comparison in both
the English and the German tables. To read your correspondent one would imagine that I
had confined myself to money figures when tabulating English trade, and to weights when
giving the corresponding instances from Germany. Your correspondent was so preoccupied
with my skilful conveyance of false impressions that he apparently overlooked the misleading
nature of many of his own impressions.</p>


<h3>EXCESS OF IMPORTS OVER EXPORTS.</h3>

<p>This anxiety has also seemingly taken his attention away from consistency in his own
statements. In the first article he rejoices over the fact that our imports exceed our exports,
regarding that circumstance as a sign of prosperity; in his second article (when he has
another sort of article in hand) he writes as follows:&mdash;&#8220;When two tradesmen have mutual
transactions, that man will feel that he is doing best who sells more to his neighbour than he
buys from him. And rightly so!&#8221; That note of exclamation is his. It also represented my
feelings when I read the statement. I am also quite at one with him in the quoted remark,
but (as in my poor way, I tried to be consistent) I am at issue when in his first article he
chuckles over the excess of imports. Suppose that excess to be made up entirely of shipping,
sale commissions, and interest on foreign investments, and that it does not imply that we are
living on our capital; even then the thing does not work out quite happily. Shipping is all
right, of course, but sale commissions less so; they spell enrichment, doubtless, to a certain
class of City men, but the working and manufacturing classes generally get nothing out of
these foreign manufactures. Still less do they share in the third item. It does not help this
country&#8217;s industries to aid the establishment of rival industries abroad, which is what foreign
investments mostly mean; while when the returns on those investments are used to purchase
foreign goods it is again difficult to see exactly where the English industrial classes come in.
With regard to the entrep&ocirc;t trade, your correspondent says that it &#8220;seems somewhat to halt
in the process&#8221; of slipping away; but as his own figures show that the sixty-seven millions
of 1889 have dwindled in six years to the sixty millions of 1895, I don&#8217;t think I need occupy
further space by combating his assertion with figures of my own.</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="formula">Yours faithfully,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Ernest E. Williams.</span></p>

<p class="tobeconcluded"><i>(To be concluded.)</i></p>



<p class="h2sub"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>MR. WILLIAMS&#8217;S REPLY.&mdash;II.</p>

<p class="letterhead"><i>To the Editor of the &#8220;Daily Graphic.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In my first article I endeavoured to show that the charges of disingenuousness
brought against me by your critic not only missed their aim, but possessed a boomerang
quality. I will ask your attention to another instance. In his second article your correspondent,
in order to damage my reputation for intellectual honesty, writes:&mdash;&#8220;Mr. Williams
has artfully picked out half-a-dozen or so items of our imports from Germany, and then
exclaims in horror at the amount of &#8216;the moneys which <i>in one year</i> have come out of John
Bull&#8217;s pocket for the purchase of his German-made household goods.&#8217;&#8221; This, in vulgar
language, is a staggerer.</p>

<p>Let me explain my artfulness. In a half-jocular section in my first chapter, I invited the
reader just to look round his own house and make an inventory of the German goods it
probably contains. I helped him with a list of the toys in the nursery, the piano in the
drawing-room, the servant&#8217;s presentation mug in the kitchen, the pencil on the study table,
&amp;c., and then tried to give point and solidity to my little excursion into the lighter style of
writing by enumerating the yearly national bill which Germany presents to us for these
household items. The correspondent (to use his own admirable verb) &#8220;twists&#8221; this into the
implication above quoted, and writes as though these were the only figures I had adduced.
Ingenuous, is it not?</p>


<h3>THE ALKALI TRADE.</h3>

<p>Now to another matter wherein the correspondent has superficially scored a point, but
has done so largely by the process of quoting me in disconnected bits. I refer to his alkali
trade section in the third article. He quotes two or three sentences of mine commenting on
some startling English export figures I had just given. Then he misses out a couple of most
important pages, and finishes the quotation with two sentences referring to the increase of
German trade. This leaving-out of the pith of the matter, and the bringing into juxtaposition
of two sets of unrelated semi-rhetorical remarks, gives to the quotation a forced and
rather <i>non sequitur</i> air. The part that was left out is too long for me to reproduce, but it
comprises a number of most pregnant instances of the havoc wrought in England&#8217;s alkali
trade, and of the great progress made in the German trade. The correspondent might, with
advantage to the forwarding of public knowledge on the subject, have made some reference
to these facts, even had it cramped the space at his disposal for inveighing against my
&#8220;grossly inaccurate impressions.&#8221; Here is a case which illustrates the necessity of my
appeal to the reader to go direct to the incriminated book.</p>


<h3>THE CHEMICAL MANURE TRADE.</h3>

<p>Neither can I admire the correspondent&#8217;s sudden and peculiar change of method in dealing
with the chemical manure trade. Anyone acquainted with the trade in sulphate of
ammonia knows how the Germans are capturing it, their estimated annual production
amounting now to 100,000 tons. It is among the most startling instances of Germany&#8217;s
wonderful progress in her chemical trades. Even the correspondent loses heart, and is fain
to confess the expansion here. But in order that he may at all hazards score a point, he
introduces the argument that &#8220;probably the British farmer ... does not regard this
competition of German with English manure manufacturers as altogether disadvantageous.&#8221;
This is all very well; but even a hard-pressed critic cannot serve two masters; he cannot set
out to prove that the Germans are not beating us, and then, when he tumbles against an
instance to the contrary which repulses all attempts to explain it away, turn round and say
that it is a very good thing. It is possible to score points in a way which does not improve
the scorer&#8217;s position. Altogether, I venture to suggest to the correspondent that his general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>case would have been strengthened had he passed over the chemical trades in discreet
silence.</p>


<h3>SOAP IMPORTS FROM GERMANY.</h3>

<p>Especially was he ill-advised when, for the purpose of bringing into greater prominence
my addiction to false statement, he burst out into italics in the following sentence: &#8220;<i>So far
as the Custom House returns show, not one single ounce of foreign soap is imported into the
United Kingdom, either from Germany or from any other country.</i>&#8221; Because the German
returns show an export of soap to England under three different headings. The correspondent
should have provided himself with Green Books as well as Blue Books before he set out
to demolish me. He would then have learned&mdash;what he should have known anyway, considering
the attention he has given to the subject&mdash;that the English Custom House returns
do not show everything.</p>


<h3>IMPORTS OF IRON.</h3>

<p>This limited acquaintance with German statistics has caused the correspondent to go
wrong on other occasions. For instance, in the fourth article he produces a table purporting
to show our iron trade with Germany, in which the iron exports from Germany to England
cut a very insignificant figure beside the English exports to Germany. To quote his own
words in another place&mdash;&#8220;Most impressive! if only it were true.&#8221; I had occasion the other
day to get out a detailed list of the German exports to England of iron and steel manufactures
in 1891; they reached a total of 109,956 tons. The correspondent gives 11,000 tons as the
total of iron manufactures; the complete total of iron and steel manufactures, according to
the source whence he obviously drew his information, was about 16,000 tons. The explanation
is of course that the English returns do not always show the actual place of origin. (It
doesn&#8217;t matter much; competition in any other name hits just as hard, and Germany, after
all, is but one rival out of many. I only used her as an instance of foreign competition
generally.)</p>


<h3>A &#8220;PETTY ACCUSATION.&#8221;</h3>

<p>This particular table is, therefore, hopelessly wrong, and is certainly valueless for any
purpose of destructive criticism. It is on this page that the correspondent brings against me
a petty accusation of which he should have been ashamed. He says that I have &#8220;skilfully
conveyed a false impression&#8221; by giving certain German figures in hundredweights and
English figures in tons. Surely he had the wit to see that I was merely transcribing figures
without stopping to translate them; and it is difficult to imagine he could think I was so
witless as to adopt a silly sleight-of-hand trick such as that of which he accuses me, a trick
which would not deceive a child in the lowest standard of a Board school.</p>


<h3>FANCIFUL FOREBODINGS?</h3>

<p>Here I must bring to an end my short, detailed criticism of the <i>Daily Graphic</i> correspondent&#8217;s
attack, for I have already exceeded the space offered to me by the editor, though
I have perforce left untouched a number of points on which I should have liked to enlarge
my defence. I have not touched the two concluding articles in the series. The last is a
statement (more lucidly and ably put than anything I remember ever to have read) of the
Free Trade position in general and the case against a Customs Union in particular; but I
have recently elsewhere stated my views on those subjects at length. Regarding the penultimate
article, I should like to say a word in conclusion. That article attacks me by a
side wind. It does not contest the facts contained in my book; on the contrary, it leads off
with an airy dismissal of &#8220;Mr. Williams and his fanciful forebodings,&#8221; and it shows, by much
rhetorical writing and some interesting illustrations, that England is a land flowing with
milk and honey and manufactures and money, and generally in a wonderful state of
millennial prosperity. My answer is two-fold. In the first place I must congratulate the
correspondent on the pleasant surroundings among which alone his days can have been
passed; but I should like to take him through some awful wildernesses I know&mdash;deserts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>&#8220;mean streets,&#8221; where half-clothed, underfed children shiver for warmth and food at the
knees of women gaunt and haggard with the suffering which hopeless poverty inflicts on
them; and by way of explanation of these grisly phenomena I would take him to the dock
gates in the early morning, where not unlikely he would see men literally fighting for
entrance because there is not work enough to go round. If that does not point him out the
cause with sufficient clearness I would suggest an examination of the employment returns of
the trade unions. There, by-the-by, he would see the greatest want of employment to be
in those trades where the pinch of foreign competition&mdash;&#8220;the harmless growth of the
German infant,&#8221; he phrases it&mdash;is most in evidence.</p>


<h3>A WARNING.</h3>

<p>In the second place, I would point out to him that the initial object of my book was to
warn the nation in the day of its prosperity&mdash;such as it is&mdash;that a grave danger was lurking
in the way. The fact that the easy-going man of business is surrounded by so many signs of
industrial prosperity, such as those which the correspondent details, only made it the more
important that he should be aroused to a knowledge of the forces that were undermining the
foundations.</p>
